1.Create freestyle job and pipeline job to install  packages using yum
  condition: package name should be given from outside
2. create a freestyle job and pipeline to build maven project and push articats to nexus
  condition: create different jobs one should use tools from jenkins tools configuration 
              other should use maven from command line not tools
3. Create freestyle job as downstream job for above maven project to deploy artifacts to tomcat using shell command
   this downstream job should execute only if upstream job (above maven job) is successful.

4. create a pipeline job to build maven project and push artifacts to nexus and  deploy artifacts to tomcat from nexus
   Condition: assign build triggers to start this job for every 30 minutes ( you can increase or decrease
              timmings for your testing) and add a condition to not deploy artifacts
              if there are no code changes.
5. Configure/Attach  a node machine to the master with 4 executors using t2.medium and write a pipleine to install docker on node

6. write a pipeline to  pull docker images and run docker containers on node machine don't use plugin use shell commands

7. Create a pipeline job to build multiple docker images in parallel ( create dockeer images)
    images1: image to perform maven builds
    image2: image with tomcat configured

8 Create pipeline to use ansible playbook plugin to run ansible playbooks ( use any type of playbooks you want to run)

9. Before creating above pipeline configure a freestyle job or pipeline to copy ssh keys to destination server from node1 
   to run ansible playbooks on destination server.
